# hng-task-1

This project (profile page) is the stage one task for HNG frontend interns.

In this project, I've developed a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to display specific personal and real-time data attributes as outlined in the project requirements. Each required element has a specified `data-testid` attribute to make identification and potential testing easier.

## Project Requirements

Let me highlight the key requirements and how I've implemented them:

### Slack Name

- I've prominently displayed my Slack name on the web page.

- Attribute: `data-testid="slackUserName"`

### Slack Display Picture

- My Slack profile picture is showcased on the page, and I've set the alt attribute to my Slack username.

- Attribute: `data-testid="slackDisplayImage"`

### Current Day of the Week

- I've indicated the current day of the week on the page, ensuring that it updates in real-time.

- Attribute: `data-testid="currentDayOfTheWeek"`

### Current UTC Time

- The current UTC time in milliseconds is displayed on the page, also updating in real-time.

- Attribute: `data-testid="currentUTCTime"`

### Track

- I've mentioned my track (Frontend) on the page to give some context.

- Attribute: `data-testid="myTrack"`

### GitHub URL

- I've provided a clickable link to my GitHub repository where you can find the source code for this project.

- Attribute: `data-testid="githubURL"`
